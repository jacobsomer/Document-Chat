I first got into programming and graphic design in middle school through making games in Python, JS, and Scratch, inspired by graphics of my favorite websites and games. Studying at UC Berkeley has helped me gain a deep technical foundation, and my experiences at both well-established and fast-growing companies helped me sharpen my talent into the professional skills to work with others to bring ideas to reality.
